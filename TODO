Open tasks, in decreasing order of priority:

* add support for shim DIF over WiFi

* io-dev: support read_iter() and write_iter() to avoid copies on
  writev() and readv()

* implement support for tailroom (needed by shim-eth)

* implement a policy for distributed bandwidth allocation

* generic RIB synchronization where needed (e.g. DFT, LFDB, neighbors)
   * a smart implementation would use some kind of hash on the RIB
     subtrees to understand when the neighbor has different (and newer)
     version of a fully-replicated subtree (e.g. DFT or Lower Flow
     database (LFDB))
   * avoid exchanging the same data again and again when not needed,
     just periodically exchange hashes (and do the full update only when
     needed)

* DTCP: RTT estimate should happen using ktime_t variables

* install: don't overwrite config files

* implement utility to graphically show dif-rib-show, using graphviz
  (DIF map with active links)
