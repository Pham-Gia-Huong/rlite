Open tasks, in decreasing order of priority:

* generic RIB synchronization where needed (e.g. DFT, LFDB, neighbors)
   * a smart implementation would use some kind of hash on the RIB
     subtrees to understand when the neighbor has different (and newer)
     version of a fully-replicated subtree (e.g. DFT or Lower Flow
     database (LFDB))
   * avoid exchanging the same data again and again when not needed,
     just periodically exchange hashes (and do the full update only when
     needed)

* implement support for tailroom (needed by shim-eth)

* let IPCP allocate and use N-flows ("self-flows") rather than N-1-flows
  over shim DIFs: this is useful to let normal IPCPs that work over
  unreliable shim to actually use a reliable flow for management SDUs
    * logic for self-registration and N-flow allocation already in place
    * the only missing thing is to actually use the N-flow and not the
      N-1, when management SDUs are to be sent or received

* routing: use IPCP names to identify graph nodes, rather than using
  addresses. This is a first step towards supporting live renumbering

* DTCP: RTT estimate should happen using ktime_t variables

* install: don't overwrite config files

* implement utility to graphically show dif-rib-show, using graphviz
  (DIF map with active links)

* support generic RIB M_READ (and M_WRITE)

* io-dev: support read_iter() and write_iter() to avoid copies on
  writev() and readv()

* minimize routing/forwarding table by introducing a "default" route
