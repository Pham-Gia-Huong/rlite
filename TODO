- rlite-utils: deserialization routines should check lengths

- support generic RIB M_READ (and M_WRITE)

- implement utility to graphically show ipcp-rib-show, using graphviz
  (DIF map with active links)

- install: don't overwrite config files

- DTCP: RTT estimate should happen using ktime_t variables

- allocate and use N-flows rather than N-1-flows over shim DIFs
    - logic for self-registration and N-flow allocation already in place
    - the only missing thing is to actually use the N-flow and not the N-1

- generic RIB synchronization where needed (e.g. DFT)

- use separate N-1 flows for management and data

- routing: use IPCP names to identify graph nodes, rather than using
  addresses. This is a first step towards supporting live renumbering
